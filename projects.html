		<p>Small sub-mW sensor devices that rely on energy
		harvesting often have limited computation capability to locally
		process, query, and update data. Such energy harvesting devices
		(EHDs) need to operate under a strict power constraint and
		are also extremely cost-sensitive. Based on current costs and
		estimated near-term trends, we observe that the price of the
		nonvolatile memory component dominates (in ~20 USD devices).
		Hence, there is a pressing need to reduce the overall memory
		footprint in a data-intensive setting.
		This paper is the first to propose a generic hardware archi-
		tecture, CmpctArch, for implementing compact data structures
		(CDSs) on such devices. They reduce the memory footprint by
		up to 3.5X without significantly increasing the overall energy
		consumption or time taken (max. additional energy 1.04X and
		time 1.18X). The hardware implementations are 160-1200X more
		energy-efficient and 280-620X faster than the corresponding
		software implementations of CDSs. Our generic template can be
		used to instantiate a wide variety of data structures commonly
		used in EHD applications.

		in Intermittent Systems [2021] </b> <p>Checkpointing plays a
		key role in energy harvesting systems. We are performing a
		detailed study of the various checkpointing approaches proposed
		by researchers. Along with a theoretical study, we are also
		comparing these approaches experimentally. There are some
		interesting questions/details about our studay that we present
		in a FAQ document, which is available <a

		<p> Energy harvesting devices (EHDs) are becoming extremely
		preva- lent in remote and hazardous environments. They sense
		the ambient parameters and compute some statistics on them,
		which are then sent to a remote server. Due to the
		resource-constrained nature of EHDs, it is challenging to
		perform exact computations on streaming data; however, if we
		are willing to tolerate a slight amount of inaccu- racy, we can
		leverage the power of sketching algorithms to provide quick
		answers with significantly lower energy consumption.  In this
		paper, we propose a novel hardware architecture called EHDSktch
		- a set of IP blocks that can be used to implement most of the
		popular sketching algorithms. We demonstrate an energy savings
		of 4-10X and a speedup of more than 10X over state-of- the-art
		software implementations. Leveraging the temporal locality
		further provides us a performance gain of 3-20% in energy and
		time and reduces the on-chip memory requirement by at least
		50-75%.</p>

		<p>With the advent of 5G and M2M architectures, energy
		harvesting devices are expected to become far more prevalent.
		Such devices harvest energy from ambient sources such as solar
		energy or vibration energy (from machines) and use it for
		sensing the environmental parameters and further processing
		them. Given that the rate of energy consumption is more than
		the rate of energy production, it is necessary to frequently
		halt the processor and accumulate energy from the environment.
		During this period it is mandatory to take a checkpoint to
		avoid the loss of data. State of the art algorithms use
		software based methods that extensively rely on compiler
		analyses.  In this work, we provide the first formal model for
		such systems, and show that we can arrive at an optimal
		checkpointing schedule using a quadratically constrained linear
		program (QCLP) solver. Using this as a baseline, we show that
		existing algorithms for checkpointing significantly
		underperform.  Furthermore, we prove and demonstrate that when
		we have a relatively constant energy source, a greedy algorithm
		provides an optimal solution.</p></li>

		<li><b style="color:blue;"> Scalable and Socially Consistent
		Systems [2018] </b> <p>This work aims to handle the system
		overloading by splitting/merging the objects.  Particularly,
		in social-networking sites like Facebook/Twitter, some posts
		can be accessed by a large number of users, resulting ina hot
		spot, which the current systems are not able to handle and
		hence resulting in enormously high latencyand finally in a
		system crash.  In our system we came up with a model in which
		the users are responded inapproximately constant time and the
		system can scale easily according to increase in the number of
		users.<p/></li>
